## Data Source
The dataset was given by Digitaley Drive, to test my knowledge of Data Analysis, after completing data Bootcamp with them. 

## Problem Statement
The analysis is to answer the following business questions:

Question 1

a.	What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?

b.	For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?

Question 2

Question 3

a.	Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries?
